        <h1>Volunteer Opportunities</h1>
        <div class="volunteers">
            <p>Volunteers are the lifeblood of the Mt Pleasant Animal Shelter. We welcome volunteers of all ages, but those under 18 must volunteer with a family member.
                To volunteer, you must attend an orientation session, which are held monthly. You also must complete the Volunteer Application2017. Complete it and bring with you to orientation.
                Orientation should last about 1 hour, then you will set up your first volunteering time with a mentor who is an experienced volunteer to show you the ins and out of everything we do here. After that you will be certified to volunteer on your own.

        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <div class="aboutUs">
            <p>The <strong>Mt. Pleasant Animal Shelter</strong> is a city operated facility with one full time director, 
                1 full time animal control officer, one part time animal control officer and many dedicated volunteers.
                 We take in stray, abandoned, injured, and homeless dogs that are within the city limits of Mt. Pleasant. 
                 We are unable to take in cats unless they are injured or un able to care for them selves, such as un-weaned,
                  and motherless kittens. Unfortunately, there is no state law or city ordinance against cats running at large at 
                  this time. Our animal control officers are responsible for responding to calls for service relating to dogs at 
                  large, dog bites, and animal cruelty. Pet owners, please don’t let your dogs roam at large at any time and keep 
                  a collar with a current rabies tag on them at all times. Provide your pet with access to food, water, adequate 
                  shelter, and vet care, if needed, at all times. This is a state law and a city ordinance. We will issue citations
                   for these violations starting at $193.00. Please be a responsible pet owner. Dogs and cats already spayed or neutered
                    at the time of adoption will have an adoption fee of $75 and can go home the same day. Dogs and cats that are not spayed 
                    or neutered at the time of adoption will have an adoption fee of $25 . Those animals will then be made a spay or neuter 
                    appointment at one of our local vets. We will take them to your choice of local vet and you will be responsible for picking up
                 your new pet and paying for their spay or neuter fee to the vet.</p>

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <ul class="FAQContainer">
            <li>Will you take my animal in? First thing we ask no matter what, “Where do you live?”
                 If you do not live in the city limits they cannot bring an animal in. 
                 If animal is found within the city limits, they have to now sign an affidavit that they 
                 found the dog inside the city limits, we have those forms at the shelter. We are no longer 
                 accepting cats unless they are critically injured/sick or ‘without a mother. Any person in
                  the County portion of Wilson County needing animal control can call them at 615-444-9775. 
                  New Leash on Life may be able to help with some cats and dogs they are 615-444-1144. 
                  Country K-9 is in Lebanon and they can sometimes help with cats but mainly just dogs.</li>
                  <li>We are NOT a no kill shelter. We do our best to adopt out animals but we cannot and will not guarantee the adoption of any animal.</li>
